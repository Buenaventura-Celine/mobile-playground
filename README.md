## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.24.0 or later)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mobile-playground

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### Configuration

#### Google Maps API Key Setup

For the location feature to work, you need to set up a Google Maps API key:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Enable the following APIs in Google Cloud Console:
   - Maps SDK for Android
   - Maps SDK for iOS
   - Directions API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API

3. See the [location implementation documentation](docs/location/location-implementation.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Development Commands
```bash
# Format code
dart format .

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Build APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```
