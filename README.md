## âœ… Accomplishments

### ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**First major milestone**: Successfully implemented a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

**Implementation Details:**

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: 
  - Triggers on every push and pull request to `main` branch
  - Automated code quality checks including formatting and static analysis
  - Comprehensive test suite execution with coverage reporting
  - Integration with Codecov for coverage tracking

- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
  - Triggers on version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
  - Automated Android APK and App Bundle builds
  - Automatic GitHub release creation with build artifacts
  - Ready-to-install APK files for direct distribution
  - App Bundle files prepared for Google Play Store deployment

**Workflow Features:**
- Flutter 3.24.0 stable channel
- Java 17 setup for Android builds
- Automated testing before deployment
- Release asset uploads with versioned naming
